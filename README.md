Pizzeria Project
Today, you‚Äôre building your own pizzeria!
I‚Äôve prepared a framework of classes and a folder structure to help you get started. All you need to do is implement everything, run it, and start selling pizzas! Good luck! üòä

Instructions
Implement the interfaces and classes
Follow the provided framework. Use the comments as hints to understand how each method should function.

Add your own implementation for each method
Ensure your logic aligns with the specified conditions and validations.

Apply SOLID principles
For example, separate responsibilities for handling orders, managing the pizzeria, and processing data, as suggested in the framework.

Create your own structure for recipes and toppings
Add a few test recipes and toppings to the respective data files.

Use the provided data and enums
Import and use enums, interfaces, and types to enable strict typing.

Test your code
Run the example in index.ts and make sure everything works as expected.

Add ESLint and Prettier
Set up ESLint and Prettier in your project to ensure a consistent code style. Add the necessary scripts and format the code to match your chosen settings.

After completing the project, your pizzeria model should be able to:
Create orders and add items to them
Calculate the total cost of orders and individual items
Delete orders and manage the order list
Happy coding, and may your pizzas be delicious! üçï
